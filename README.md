### This is a web application that delivers randomly generated inspirational quotes each time the user clicks a button. This is primarily a front-end project involving jQuery and Bootstrap CSS. This project was inspired by the following: 
* Quotes from Dove Chocolates
* Spotify playlists for 'confidence boosting' 
* The fact that several aspiring web developers suffer from imposter syndrome
